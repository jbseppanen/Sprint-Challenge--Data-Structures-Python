Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?
    O(1)
2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?
    O(1)
3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
    O(n)
4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?
    O(n)
    
5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    O(n^2)
6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
    O(n)
7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    O(2(n log n)) for the sorting.
    O(n) to iterate through the lists.
    So that would be O(2(n log n) + n) which reduces down to O(n).
    So O(n) is the answer.
8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
    O(n)
